### What I Learned 🎓
This stage was a great mix of **theory** and **hands-on practice**, where I gained:
- An understanding of **linear and logistic regression** for predictive modeling.
- The fundamentals of **neural networks** and their applications in real-world problems.
- Practical experience with **image compression** techniques.
  
I’m excited to continue exploring the world of AI and apply these concepts to more advanced topics in future stages! 🚀
