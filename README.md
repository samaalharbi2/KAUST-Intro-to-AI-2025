I’m proud to share that I’ve completed **Stage 2** of the **KAUST AI Specialization Program**! 🎓

This stage focused on **Introduction to AI** and covered a range of essential topics that have laid a strong foundation for my understanding of AI and deep learning. Here's a quick overview of the key topics we explored:

## Key Topics Covered 📚
1. **Linear Regression** 📈
2. **Logistic Regression** 🔢
3. **Neural Networks** 🧠
4. **Image Compression** 🖼️

### What I Learned 🎓
This stage was a great mix of **theory** and **hands-on practice**, where I gained:
- An understanding of **linear and logistic regression** for predictive modeling.
- The fundamentals of **neural networks** and their applications in real-world problems.
- Practical experience with **image compression** techniques.
  
I’m excited to continue exploring the world of AI and apply these concepts to more advanced topics in future stages! 🚀
